The ad.html has a very specific format.

Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
your hit.

The second part of the ad display after the person selected
"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

See comments throughout for hints

       <p>A lab studying Human-Computer Interaction at <b>University of California, Berkeley</b> is looking for online
        participants for a brief experiment on attention.</p>

        <p>The study will take anywhere from 20-30 minutes and it must be done in one sitting.
          If you cannot do this, please return the hit and feel free to try later.
        </p>
        
        <p>The study requires participants to watch a 4-minute video and then play a driving game
        for 10 minutes and finally fill out a brief survey. There is an optional
        additional survey for a bonus of $1.50.
      </p>
      <p>You can earn up to a total of $5.50 if you earn the bonuses.</p>
      <p>Bonuses are earned from performance in the driving game and completion of
        the additional survey. </p>
      <p>Eligibility for the bonus is contingent on your behavior. Please keep the game as your primary
        window and read the surveys carefully.
         </p>

         <p>WARNING: The surveys will not work on the latest release of Firefox. Please use a difference browser.</p>

       <p>The requirements for participation are:</p>

       <ul>
          <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
          <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
          <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
       may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

       <div class="alert alert-warning">
         <strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong>
         If you have already started or completed this task the system will not

         with the same title as this one, please return this HIT.

         Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site
         above to begin the task.

     You should thus show them instructions to begin the
     experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
     window pointed at your server.

                 It is important you do not change the code for the
                 openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
