#1. Slow down everything
#2. Slow down, and space out spawned entities
#3. Abstract representations  (choose from random mix bag) for entities 
#4. Right pane
    #4.1 Removes the scores, arrow images
    #4.2 Mapping entities 
    #4.3 Change the road image
#5. Distance Mark function
#6. One thing marked at the time - need more details
7. Interface panel - tied to time function, question
    7.1 Display keyboard key icons next to item legend
    #7.2 Display the question - "What is the boxed item?"
    7.3 Keyboard interface for providing input
        #7.3.1 blink frame color green
        #7.3.2 blink frame color red
        #7.3.3 blink frame color blue
        7.3.4 Map keys - Q, W, E
        7.3.5 Get only one input per box and store it in boxedType variable (undecided, cash, life, obstacles)
        7.3.6 When rendering cash, life, obstacles, 
                7.3.6.1 if isBoxed is false, then auto-set boxedType to cash, life, obstacle
                        else if isBoxed is true, then set boxedType to undecided isUnrecognized
    7.4 Bar for time remaining
        7.4.1 Vary boxing distances (aka timeout for system recognition failure)
        7.4.2 Calculate time remaining based on speed and remaining distance
        7.4.3 Visualize time bar - for time remaining
        7.4.4 if time elapses - give -ve feedback - blink frame red
        7.4.5 isBoxed is a misnomer - 
    7.5 Separate pane for the interface - look at the amendment document
8. Box them based on two different criteria
    8.1 Environment query - based on hard time constraint rather than probablity
    8.2 Attention query -  based on probablity (existing one)
    8.3 Deploy attention query only when Environment query is inactive
        8.3.1 Environment query takes precedence
        8.3.2 Should not be posed around a time window of the Env. query
#9. Car controller for driving this - PID
    9.1 Controller triggered upon human identification for unknown objects
10. Distractor task panel
